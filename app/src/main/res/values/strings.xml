    <string name="about_me_tv"><u>About Me</u></string>
    <string name="about_me"><b>My name is Mobolaji Alexander ODESANMI.</b> A fourth year undergraduate student at <i>Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria.</i>, I am pursuing BTech in Computer Science and Engineering.
        \n\nI am very passionate about Mobile Application Development. I am always ready to challenge myself and explore new areas of work. I never stop learning new things, and for me, each new project is a new adventure.
        \n\nI love designing Architectural Home. I also use Canva to design graphics used in my apps and for friends that need a flyer for their business.
        \n\nRecently, i started web designs.
        \n\nFor more information concerning my portfolio, kindly visit the following web pages links indicated earlier above as I use Miniweam as a name to showcase my work.
